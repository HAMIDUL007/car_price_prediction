# car_price_prediction


##About

Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the American market. 
We're about to explore the world of cars, solve mysteries, and have a good laugh along the way!

The dataset for this project is derived from Kaggle.


## About Data
This car price prediction dataset have 205 rows and 26 colums.From where we have to select a suitable dependent variable 
concerning independent variables.
